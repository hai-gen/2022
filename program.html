            <h3>AI Models as a Shared Creative Resource</h3>
            <h4><em>The Human Use of New Machines</em></h4>
            <p>This talk is born out of a series of collaborations with deep generative models that capture human
                creativity at different scales. These tools hold a beautiful promise: within reach is the ability for
                anyone to collaborate with executable models of individual and collective cultural history, on a
                timeline allowing experimentation and rapid evolution in the present. To fully realize this future, we
                need modes of multiplexing creation, across platforms and processes, that are understood as a
                magnification of creative identity rather than a dilution. How can we establish infrastructure and norms
                around contributing to shared models, and around the idea of models as a shared resource? At their best,
                such models both facilitate co-creation and provide a context for interpreting the structure underlying
                human creativity and perception &mdash; a feedback loop befitting a 21st century articulation of
                iterative creativity.</p>
            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>Sarah Schwettmann is a neuroscientist and machine learning researcher at MIT CSAIL. She completed her PhD
                in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, where she was an NSF Fellow. Her work investigates generalizable
                representations for vision in biological and artificial neural networks. She is broadly interested in
                creativity underlying the human relationship to the world: from the brain's fundamentally constructive
                role in sensory perception to the explicit creation of experiential worlds in art. Sarah designed and
                teaches MIT's first course on Vision in Art and Neuroscience, and leads research efforts in the MIT
                Museum Studio.</p>
            <p>Sarah has translated her work into a wide range of collaborations, including with The Metropolitan Museum
                of Art, MIT Open Learning, Microsoft Research, the Knowledge Futures Group, MIT Quest for Intelligence,
                MFA Boston, Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, and the MIT Museum. Prior to MIT
                she lived in Houston, Texas, where her work was in theoretical neuroscience.</p>
